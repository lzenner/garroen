------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod requires EET, BG1EE, SoD, or BG2EE.

Adds a romance between Garrick and Imoen, making Garrick available as a joinable NPC whenever Imoen is in the group or in need of rescuing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BG1EE Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requires BG1EE or EET
The romance will begin if Garrick and Imoen are both in the group or are 'parked' in the same location.  If the Garrick's Infatuation mod is installed and both he and Imoen are in the group, the romance will begin after he declares you are his best friend.  Whatever remains of the infatuation will be skipped once their romance begins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requires SoD or EET
The romance will continue from BG1EE if installed or will commence when Garrick is attempting to perform at the Elfsong Tavern.  Garrick will join Imoen as a recruitable NPC if the SoD portion of the Imoen Forever mod is installed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BG2EE Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requires BG2EE or EET
For EET, the romance will only continue if it was started in the previous campaigns.  For a non-EET installation, it is assumed the relationship proceeded to the point to where Garrick will come looking for Imoen.

INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If installing Endless BG1 (https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/217-endless-bg1/), or Transitions (https://github.com/lzenner/transitions/releases/latest), do so before install this mod.  

Installation using Project Infinity (https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/comment/1145416/#Comment_1145416) will ensure this and other mods are installed in the correct order.

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 

When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

IMPORTANT: EET_End will need to be reinstalled after installing this mod.
 
General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be a transitions folder and a setup-transitions.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-transitions.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-transitions.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
The mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, then copy of the contents of the folder into your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "transitions" folder, setup-transitions, and setup-transitions.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-transitions.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your EET installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already run it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safest bet.
Run WeInstall transitions in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. 

If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please post your bug report in the forum thread: https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/???/.
