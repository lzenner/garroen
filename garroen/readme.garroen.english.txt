------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod requires EET, BG1EE, SoD, or BG2EE.

Adds a romance between Garrick and Imoen, making Garrick available as a joinable NPC whenever Imoen is joinable or in need of rescuing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BG1EE Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The romance will begin if Garrick and Imoen are both in the group or are both 'parked' in Feldepost's Inn.  If the Garrick's Infatuation mod is installed and both he and Imoen are in the group, the romance will begin after he declares you are his best friend and the rest of the infatuation will be skipped.  The infatuation will also end if they are parked together in Feldepost's Inn for more than 5 days. If you force them to part company, the romance will pause until they're either together again or SoD starts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The romance will continue from BG1EE (if EET, Transitions, or Ever BG1 are installed) or will commence with the start of SoD.  In SoD, he'll be found in Three Old Kegs instead of Elfsong Tavern.  Garrick will join Imoen as a recruitable NPC if the SoD portion of the Imoen Forever mod is installed.  Otherwise, the romance counter will simply continue to tick and they'll be a committed couple by the end of SoD.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BG2EE Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For EET, the romance will only continue if it was started in the previous campaigns.  For a non-EET installation, it is assumed the relationship proceeded to the point to where Garrick will come looking for Imoen. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLANNED FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Change Imoen's position in the inns if Garrick isn't parked there
* Add sailing days to romance days
* Make sure they've been out of the group for 25 days prior to wedding
* Make sure they've been married for 25 days prior to moving to 'settled' scenes
* Add BG1 situational dialogue  
	- Either of them are badly injured or die
	- Imoen asks/hints about Garrick if he's not in the group (if they've met)
* Jaheirafan Today at 11:54 AM 
	- you could, like, suggest a certain homeliness, think about it: the PC, ever lonely traveling forward, but in the certainty that he has an extended family meaning Garrick and Immy, waiting for him

INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If installing Endless BG1 (https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/217-endless-bg1/), or Transitions (https://github.com/lzenner/transitions/releases/latest), do so before install this mod.  

Installation using Project Infinity (https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/comment/1145416/#Comment_1145416) will ensure this and other mods are installed in the correct order.

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 

When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

IMPORTANT FOR EET INSTALLATIONS: EET_End will need to be reinstalled after installing this mod.
 
General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be a transitions folder and a setup-transitions.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-transitions.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-transitions.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
The mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, then copy of the contents of the folder into your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "transitions" folder, setup-transitions, and setup-transitions.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-transitions.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your EET installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already run it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safest bet.
Run WeInstall transitions in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. 

If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please post your bug report in the forum thread: https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/???/.
